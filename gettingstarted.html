            <p>To begin starting to code in NodeJS you need to actually install the runtime on your computer. You will need to head over to Node Js website and download the latest version. This will also install NPM (node package manager) which allows you to install a TON of other javascript or node modules useful in your project.</p>
            <p>After you have installed node you can actually begin creating files and start coding. First create a folder on your desktop called "simple-project" or whatever you want to call it. Open this folder and create a file called "app.js" or any other name with the extension of ".js". next you will need to open that file in an IDE or code editing software (I recommend Visual Studio Code). Once the file is open you can start programming! But lets first log some sample text in the console, in the document type "console.log('Hello world!')" [without the quotation marks obviously]. Then open your terminal in the directory that has the file in it and run "node app". This will run the javascript file and you should see "Hello World!" printed in the console!
