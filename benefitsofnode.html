                    <div class="fake-ul">
                        <p class="li-lg">• Easy to Learn</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"Since JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, most of the front-end developers have a good grasp over it. It becomes much easier for them to start using the Node.js at the backend. It is easier to learn Node.js and consumes less time to work with it."</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• NPM</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">When installing node you get access to NPM or Node Package Manager giving you the freedom to import a ton of other javascript frameworks and materials (ex. express js, etc.)</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• Front End and Backend</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">NodeJS is both a front-end and backend framework allowing you to work on server-sided database connections and also work on the front-end html using routes.</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• Node.js is used as a Single Programming Language</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"Node.js offers the developers the luxury of writing the server-side applications in the JavaScript. This allows the Node.js developers to write both the front-end as well as the back-end web application in JavaScript using a runtime environment. And they don’t need to use any other server-side programming language. It also makes the deployment of the web applications simpler because almost all the web browsers support JavaScript."</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• Known for Offering High Performance</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"Node.js uses Google's v8 Javascript engine. This engine complies the JavaScript code directly into the machine code. This makes it easier and faster to implement the code in a effective manner. The speed of the code execution also enhanced by runtime environment as it supports the non-blocking I/O operations."</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• More Development Time</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"The fact that Node.js is unopinionated can also be seen as a drawback by some developers. Ruby on Rails provides you with a lot of directions from a fresh install and guides you into their way of doing things, but with Node.js you basically need to write everything from scratch. It might result in a decrease in productivity, slowing your work down. However, if you cooperate with an experienced team of programmers who have internally developed a good processes for developing and maintaining code, you do not have to worry about efficiency."<p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• Not Suitable for Heavy-Computing Apps</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"Node.js doesn’t support multi-threaded programming yet. It is able to serve way more complicated applications than Ruby, but it’s not suitable for performing long-running calculations. Heavy computations block the incoming requests, which can lead to decrease of performance . While Node.js is perfect for complex apps, in the case of software which requires some heavy-computing it might perform less effectively."</p>

                        <p class="li-lg">• Immaturity of Tools</p>
                        <p class="has-text-left subsec subsec-sm">"Even though, the core Node.js is stable, many packages in the npm registry (pre-installed node package manager that organises the installation and management of third-party Node.js programs) are still of poor quality or have not been properly documented. As it is mostly an open source ecosystem, numerous tools have not been supervised and so they might lack the quality and fail at meeting coding standards. The npm’s structure makes it harder to spot reliable packages. Therefore, you might need more experienced developers who can find tools that can be trusted."</p>
